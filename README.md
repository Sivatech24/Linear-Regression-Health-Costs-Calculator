Import Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary libraries imported. You'll need libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn.

Load and Preprocess Data: Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, converting categorical data to numerical format, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Create Model: Define a regression model. You can use a simple linear regression model to start with.

Train Model: Train the model using the training dataset and the corresponding labels.

Evaluate Model: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the testing dataset. Calculate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Predict Expenses: Use the trained model to predict healthcare costs for the testing dataset.

Visualize Results: Visualize the predicted expenses compared to the actual expenses using graphs or plots.
